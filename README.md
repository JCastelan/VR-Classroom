# VR-Classroom
A VR application that allows students to watch streams of university lectures and interact with professors.

The app supports both student and professor users. Professors can set up and record lectures/session, ask questions, and receive responses from students. Students can send responses and choose lectures to watch.

Our app uses the TokBox API for live video chat and viewing. It was a small project and a top contender for the 2018 UCSC hackathon CruzHacks.
